A machine learning project to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company.

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer data to predict which customers are likely to churn (cancel their service). The notebook includes:

- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Feature selection using statistical methods
- Model training with Random Forest classifier
- Model evaluation metrics

## Dataset

The dataset used is from IBM's Telco Customer Churn dataset, containing 21 features about customers including:

- Demographic information (gender, senior citizen status, etc.)
- Account details (tenure, contract type, payment method)
- Services subscribed (phone, internet, online security, etc.)
- Charges (monthly and total)
- Churn status (target variable)

The dataset contains 7043 customer records.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- The packages listed in `requirements.txt`

Install requirements with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
